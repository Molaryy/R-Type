## Getting started 🔧

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Raylib**: Ensure that Raylib is installed. If it's not, refer to the [Raylib installation guide.](https://www.raylib.com/)

- **CMake**: Ensure that CMake is installed on your system. If not, check out the [CMake installation documentation.](https://cmake.org/download/)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Molaryy/R-Type.git
   cd R-Type

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   ./bin/setup.sh build

> Note: Ensure you are in the root directory of the project before running the above command. This will generate the binaries for the server (r-type_server) and the client (r-type_client).

3. Run the project :

- Open a terminal and start the server:
   ```bash
   ./r-type_server

- Open another terminal and start the client:
   ```bash
   ./r-type_client

4. Clean the build files (if necessary):

   ```bash
   ./bin/setup.sh clean
> This will clean the build files and remove the r-type_server and r-type_client binaries.
