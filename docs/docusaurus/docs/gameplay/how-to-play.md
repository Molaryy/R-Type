## The game
![game](./assets/gamemode.gif)
Here you will find the **Start** button as well as a "Gamemode" click on it to choose between the 2 available gamemodes:
- **Campaign**: A level based game mode where you have to destroy all the asteroids to pass to the next level.
- **Endless**: A game mode where you have to survive as long as possible.

## The gameplay

Your `Life` is represented by the green bar at the top of your ship. You have to avoid the asteroids and destroy them by shooting them with your ship's bullets. You can move your ship with the `arrow keys` and shoot with the `space bar`.

Colliding with an asteroid or a ship/ship's bullet will make you lose some life.

This is an example of the gameplay in `endless` mode. You have to survive as long as possible by destroying the asteroids.

In `campaign` mode, you have to destroy all the asteroids as well as the boss to pass to the next level.
