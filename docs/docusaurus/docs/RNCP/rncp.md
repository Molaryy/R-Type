## Accessibility by Sounds

### Where do we make it ?

Essentially in the main menu when the user is selecting a section like settings etc ...\
So, to help people who have difficulties to see or read, we put a voice on each section to spell the section.

Also, if the user is not adapted to use a mouse, we made possible for him to navigate in the menu by Keys inputs like arrows.
