## Accessibility Features Utility

Accessibility features are essential for making applications usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. In our application, we have implemented several features to enhance accessibility :

### Text-to-Speech

When the user clicks the "Accessibility" button, a text-to-speech feature is activated. This feature reads out each menu item aloud when the user hovers over it with the mouse. This is particularly useful for individuals with vision or reading difficulties, as it allows them to navigate the menu by listening to the available options.

### Keyboard Navigation

For users who are not comfortable using a mouse, we have also enabled menu navigation through keyboard keys, such as the arrow keys. This allows users with motor difficulties to easily navigate the application without the need for a mouse.

These features demonstrate our commitment to making our application accessible to everyone by providing tools that help users interact with the application in a more intuitive and inclusive way.
