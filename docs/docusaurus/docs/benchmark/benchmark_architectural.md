# Benchmark of architectural design patern

Comparative study of the **ECS**, **OOP**, **CBA** architectural paterns, for a complex project such as **R-Type**, guide how software components interact, how they are organized, and how data flows through the system.

## **Comparison Criteria**

The **architectural paterns** are evaluated according to the following criteria:

- **Easy to use**: Simplicity of Setup and Implementation.
- **Functionality**: Core Features and Capabilities.
- **Community and documentation**: Size of community and quality of available documentation.
- **Adaptability for complex projects**: Scalability, Performance and Flexibility.

## **Results**

| **Criteria**                  | **ECS**                                                                                                                                         | **OOP**                                                                                                                    | **Component-Based Architecture (CBA)**                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of Use**               | ⭐⭐⭐: Steep learning curve due to the data-driven nature and need to rethink how entities and systems interact.                                     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Very familiar to most developers; straightforward to understand and implement.                                       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Requires understanding of component-based design, but not as steep as ECS. More intuitive than ECS for modular systems. |
| **Features**                  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Highly flexible, efficient, and scalable for real-time systems, games, or applications with complex, large-scale data.                    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Excellent for structured, hierarchical models of real-world entities with inheritance and polymorphism.              | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Flexible and modular, allowing easy addition or removal of features via components. Well-suited for dynamic behavior. |
| **Community / Documentation** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐: ECS is gaining traction, especially in game development (e.g., Unity's ECS). Growing documentation and resources, but less mature than OOP. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Huge community, extensive documentation, and resources. Well-supported in most programming languages and frameworks. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Solid community, especially in game development and UI frameworks. Growing, but not as universally supported as OOP.    |
| **Adaptability**              | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Extremely adaptable for large-scale systems, especially for games, simulations, or real-time applications.                                | ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Adaptable, but inheritance and complex hierarchies can make it harder to adapt when requirements change or scale.      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Very adaptable, particularly for systems requiring modularity and dynamic behavior. Easy to add new features.         |
| **Overall**                   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Best suited for performance-intensive, real-time applications like games or simulations. Complex to set up but highly scalable.           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Ideal for systems with clear hierarchical relationships. Scalable, but complexity grows with larger systems.           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: A great middle-ground between flexibility, performance, and maintainability. Ideal for modular and dynamic systems.   |

## **Conclusion**

For a complex project like **R-Type**, **ECS** is the best choices :

- Optimal **performance** for Large-Scale.
- High **scalability** for large projects.
- **ECS** is highly modular.
