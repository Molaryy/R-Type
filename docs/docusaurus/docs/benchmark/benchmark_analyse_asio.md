## Benchmark Methodology

To evaluate ASIO's performance, the following benchmarks were conducted:

1. **Latency Measurement**:

   - Round-trip time (RTT) for a small payload (e.g., 64 bytes).
   - Measured under low and high concurrency scenarios.
2. **Throughput Test**:

   - Total data transfer rate for large payloads (e.g., 1 MB).
   - Measured under various concurrency levels.
3. **Connection Scalability**:

   - Maximum number of simultaneous connections the library can handle before degradation.
4. **CPU and Memory Usage**:

   - Resource utilization under high load.
